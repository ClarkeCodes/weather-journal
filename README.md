# Weather Journal App Project :sunny:

Project three of Udacity's Frontend Developer Nanodegree. 

## Overview
From the course: "This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI."

For this project I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get current weather info based on the user's zip code. The user can input their zip (US only) and enter their feelings, which will generate a journal entry.
